            Latkes (a.k.a. potato pancakes)
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated onion</li>
                <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix potato, onion, eggs, crushed crackers, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat</li>
                <li>Drop spoonfuls of the potato mixture, first pressing potato mixture 
                    against the side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into the hot oil; 
                    slightly flatten the latkes into the oil with the back of your spoon 
                    so they are an even thickness.</li>
                <li>Cook in batches in the hot oil until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side.
                    Drain latkes on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            </ol>
